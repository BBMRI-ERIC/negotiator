# Contribution guidelines

We are really glad you are seeing this and are considering contributing to the development of the
Negotiator.
We welcome any pull requests that help us grow as open-source software!

## Development Environment

Our core developers use the [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and UNIX based Operating systems.
and can therefore be more helpful in debugging any potential problems in your local development
environment.

### Running the backend in development mode

> [!Warning] Prerequisites
> - Java 21
> - Maven 3.9 and newer
> - Docker Engine 27.0 and newer (Application will spin up a PostgreSQL databse using
    the [testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com) framework)
> - Unallocated Ports 8081 and 5432

To run the backend in development mode, run the following command.
Spring applications support hot reload with some limitations,
for a detailed explanation refer to
their [documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/using/devtools.html).

```shell
mvn clean spring-boot:test-run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev 
```

> [!TIP]
> The Database is available at the URL visible bellow with default credentials negotiator:negotiator:
> `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/negotiator`
### Known problems

#### WSL

The current development environment setup is problematic with the WSL.
Make sure your networking configuration is properly adjusted, especially when using an OIDC provider or a UI client.

For WSL debugging you can use the following command to run the backend in debug mode:

```shell
# This script is used to perform remote debugging of a Spring Boot application in debug mode in a WSL or Linux environment
mvn clean spring-boot:test-run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments="-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=*:5005"
```

Additionally enable restart in your IDE, so that it can pick up the changes you make to the code in application-dev.yaml: 

```yaml
spring:
  devtools:
    restart:
      enabled: true
```

## Code style

For maintaining a uniform code style through the code base, please adhere to the
[Google Java Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).
To enforce this, we have set up a GitHub action that checks the code style of any modified files
using the [fmt-maven-plugin](https://github.com/spotify/fmt-maven-plugin).
You can also set up an IntelliJ IDEA plugin
[google-java-format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format).
