# Network Manger

A Network Manager in the Negotiator is a person responsible for overseeing a group of resources collectively known as a
Network. The term "resource" refers to any entity an organization makes accessible, such as a collection of biological
samples, a dataset, or a service like providing expertise.

Network Managers play a crucial role in:

* Moderating access requests (Negotiations) for resources within their Network.
* Evaluating basic key performance indicators (KPIs) to ensure the efficient operation of the Network.
## Registering Representatives

Every resource in the Negotiator requires at least one designated Representative. Representatives are the primary
contacts for new Requests, ensuring a smooth process for resource access.
