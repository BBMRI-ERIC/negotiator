# Network Manger

A Network Manager in the Negotiator
is a person who is responsible for overseeing a group of resources called a **Network**.
Note that the term resource refers to any entity an Organization allows access to. It can be a collection of biological
samples, a dataset or a service such as expertise.
They are expected to moderate access requests (Negotiations) for resources in a given Network,
and to evaluate basic key performance indicators.

## Registering Representatives

Each resource requires at least one Representative in the Negotiator to whom any new Requests are forwarded.
For more detailed documentation click [here](/representative).
To Register such a Representative for a Resource in the Negotiator,
click on "Manage Resource Representatives" where you will be redirected to our Authentication and Authorization
Infrastructure (AAI).
You should Sign in using the same credentials as for the Negotiator.
There depending on the number of networks you manage you should see at least 3 groups as visible in the image bellow.
Their description outlines what membership in specific groups entails.
