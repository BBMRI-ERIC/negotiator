## Transferring a Negotiation

The negotiation transfer feature lets you reassign a negotiation to another user by entering their Subject ID. After a
successful transfer, you will lose access to the negotiation.

### How to Transfer a Negotiation

1. **Find the Negotiation**: Locate the negotiation in the sidebar or list.
2. **Open the Modal**:
    - Click the **Transfer** button (person icon with “Transfer” label).
    - Or, use **Tab** to focus and press **Enter**/**Space**.
3. **Enter Subject ID**:
    - Type the new owner’s Subject ID (e.g., `1001@bbmri.eu`) in the **Subject ID** field.
    - Find the ID on the user’s profile page.
    - Press **Enter** or click **Confirm** to submit.
4. **Review the Outcome**:
    - **Success**: A green message shows, e.g., “Negotiation successfully transferred to John Doe!
      Redirecting to
      homepage...”.
      After 2 seconds, you’re redirected to the homepage.
    - **Error**: A red error message appears, e.g., “Invalid Subject ID. Please check and try again.” Correct the ID and
      retry.
    - Common errors:
        - “Invalid Subject ID” (wrong or non-existent ID)
        - “Not authorized” (lacking permission)
        - “Negotiation or user not found”
        - “Network error” (connection issue)

### Tips

- **Verify ID**: Check the Subject ID on the user’s profile to avoid errors.
- **Permissions**: Ensure you have transfer rights; contact an admin if denied.
- **Connection**: Retry if a network error occurs.
- **Review**: Check negotiation details before transferring, as you’ll lose access.
